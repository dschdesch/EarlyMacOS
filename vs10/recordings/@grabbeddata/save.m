function D = save(D, varargin);
% eventdata/save - save for grabbed data.
%
%   GD = Save(GD) returns GD unaltered. It is left to the subclasses of 
%   Grabbeddata to provide their own save methods. 
%
%   For an example of this overloading, adc_data/save.
%   grabbeddata/save is called in dataset/save.
