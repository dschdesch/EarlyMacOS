function cleanup(G, varargout);
% eventdata/cleanup - cleanup temporary data associated with eventdata.
%   cleanup(D) removes any temporary data associated with D from disk.
%   To date, Eventdata objects do not have temporary data on disk, so
%   this method is void. It is needed anyhow, because cleanup must be
%   overloaded for all grabbeddata subclasses.

%   See also grabbedata/cleanup, dataset/cleanup.
