% calibrate - amplitude and phase transfer for acoustically flat transfer
%   [DL, Dphi, Dt, binCompDt]=calibrate(EXP, Fsam, chanStr, Fstim) computes 
%   the level term DL and phas e term Phi that compensate the acoustic
%   transfer at stimulus frequency Fstim determined during calibration, and
%   the group delay Dt of the DAC-to-acoustical path and the waveform delay
%   binCompDt that must be used to compensate interaural difference in Dt
%   values. The inputs are
%        EXP: experiment definition including the calibration data
%       Fsam: sample rate Hz
%    chanStr: DAchannel, L|R
%      Fstim: stimulus freq [Hz]. If none of the stim freqs are positive, 
%             and at least one stim freq is negative, the absolute value of
%             stimfreq is used, and anything outside the calibration range 
%             gets DL=0 dB and Dphi=0 cycle. The default behavior (i.e. 
%             when specifying all non-negative Fstim) is to throw an
%             error when any component of Fstim is outside the calibration
%             range of EXP.
%   The outputs are
%         DL: Level difference [dB] between numerical and acoustical
%             intensities. If W is the numerical sinusoid to be sent to the
%             DA converter, and the intensity of W is Lw dB_num,  then the
%             corresponding tone has a level of SPL = Lw-DL dB SPL. Here
%             dB_num is the power in dB of array W re RMS=1. Thus when
%             computing a tone at frequency Fstim, the amplitude of the
%             tone must be A = sqrt(2)*dB2A(X+DL) in order to realize a
%             sound pressure level of X dB SPL. The sqrt(2) factor comes
%             from the RMS of a unity-amplitude sinusoid, which is sqrt(1/2).
%       Dphi: Phase difference (cycle) between numerical and acoustical
%             waveforms. In order to get, at time t, a phase Phi_acoust of 
%             the acoustical waveform, the phase Phi of the numerical 
%             waveform W must equal Phi = Phi_acoust+Dphi. Importantly,
%             this phase difference does *not* include the overall group
%             delay Dt evaluated over the complete range calibration
%             frequencies. This is because one should not compensate a 
%             true time delay by phases of the components in cases in which
%             the envelope is constructed in the time domain (gating), as
%             this would create a discrepancy between the timing of the
%             waveform fine structure and that of the imposed gating.
%         Dt: global group delay [ms] of the calibration data. Estimate of 
%             the electrical+acoustical delay. If a wideband waveform is 
%             converted at time zero, the mean arrival time of its 
%             acoustical energy is at Dt. This group delay should not be
%             "compensated" when computing stimulus waveforms (see above 
%             comments on Dphi). The Dt parameter, however, is important 
%             at analysis time, when interpreting spike data and their 
%             latencies and group delays re the acoustical waveform.
%  binCompDt: zero if this DAchannel is lagging the other in terms of Dt;
%             minus the difference if this DAchannel is the leading one.
%             Delaying the waveform of this DAchannel by binDt will 
%             compensate the interaural asymmetry in latency caused by 
%             acoustical or electrical differences in the D/A-to-eardrum 
%             path. When only one channel is active (monaural calibration 
%             data), binCompDt is zero by convention.
%
%   [PhaseFac, dum, Dt, binCompDt]=calibrate(EXP, Fsam, chanStr, Fstim, 1)
%   returns the calibration as complex phase factors, i.e.,
%        PhaseFac = db2a(DL).*exp(2*pi*i*Dphi)
%
%   Note that both Dt and binDt are independent of Fstim, but may vary
%   with Fsam.
%          
%   When stimFreq is an array, both L and Phi are arrays of the same size.
